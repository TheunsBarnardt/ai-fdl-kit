## States

**State field:** `status`

**Values:**

| State | Initial | Terminal |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `draft` | Yes |  |
| `pending` |  |  |
| `in_review` |  |  |
| `approved` |  | Yes |
| `rejected` |  | Yes |
| `escalated` |  |  |
| `withdrawn` |  | Yes |

**Transitions:**

| Name | From | To | Actor | Condition |
|------|------|----|-------|-----------|
|  | `draft` | `pending` | requester |  |
|  | `pending` | `in_review` | system |  |
|  | `in_review` | `in_review` | system | current level approved but more levels remain |
|  | `in_review` | `approved` | approver | final level approved |
|  | `in_review` | `rejected` | approver |  |
|  | `in_review` | `escalated` | system | timeout_hours exceeded without response |
|  | `escalated` | `in_review` | escalation_target |  |
|  | `pending` | `withdrawn` | requester |  |
|  | `in_review` | `withdrawn` | requester |  |

## Rules

- **approval_strategy:**
  - **description:** Each level defines a strategy: "all" requires every approver to approve, "any" requires at least one, "first" accepts the first response (approve or reject). The strategy is evaluated per level independently.

- **timeout_escalation:**
  - **description:** If no approver at a level responds within timeout_hours, the request is escalated. Escalation routes to the configured escalation_target or the next level's approvers.

- **delegation:**
  - **description:** An approver can delegate their approval authority to another user for a specified period. The delegate's decisions carry the same weight as the original approver's. Delegations expire automatically after valid_until.

- **immutable_history:**
  - **description:** Once an approval action is recorded in approval_history, it cannot be modified or deleted. Each entry includes approver, action, comment, and timestamp for audit compliance.

- **auto_approve:**
  - **description:** Configurable rules can automatically approve a level without human intervention (e.g., requests under a certain amount or from specific roles). Auto-approved entries are logged in history with actor "system".

- **withdrawal_rules:**
  - **description:** A requester can withdraw their request at any point before the final approval. Withdrawal is recorded in history and notifies all involved approvers.

- **no_self_approval:**
  - **description:** A requester cannot approve their own request. If the requester appears in an approval level's approver list, they are skipped for that level.


## SLA

| Scope | Max Duration | Escalation |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| level_response_time | 48h | escalate to next approver in hierarchy or designated escalation_target |
| total_approval_time | 168h | notify system administrator |

## Outcomes

### Request_submitted (Priority: 1)

**Given:**
- requester is authenticated
- `approval_levels` (input) exists
- `title` (input) exists

**Then:**
- **transition_state** field: `status` from: `draft` to: `pending`
- **emit_event** event: `approval.requested`
- **notify** — First-level approvers notified of pending request

**Result:** Request submitted and routed to first approval level

### Level_approved_all_strategy (Priority: 2)

**Given:**
- current level strategy is 'all'
- all approvers at the current level have approved

**Then:**
- **set_field** target: `current_level` value: `current_level + 1`
- **emit_event** event: `approval.approved`

**Result:** Current level approved; request advances to next level or completes

### Level_approved_any_strategy (Priority: 3)

**Given:**
- current level strategy is 'any'
- at least one approver at the current level has approved

**Then:**
- **set_field** target: `current_level` value: `current_level + 1`
- **emit_event** event: `approval.approved`

**Result:** Current level approved by any single approver; advances

### Level_approved_first_strategy (Priority: 4)

**Given:**
- current level strategy is 'first'
- first approver at the current level has responded with approve

**Then:**
- **set_field** target: `current_level` value: `current_level + 1`
- **emit_event** event: `approval.approved`

**Result:** First response accepted; level complete

### Request_fully_approved (Priority: 5)

**Given:**
- all approval levels have been approved
- current_level equals total number of levels

**Then:**
- **transition_state** field: `status` from: `in_review` to: `approved`
- **emit_event** event: `approval.approved`
- **notify** — Requester notified of full approval

**Result:** Request fully approved across all levels

### Request_rejected (Priority: 6)

**Given:**
- an approver at any level rejects the request

**Then:**
- **transition_state** field: `status` from: `in_review` to: `rejected`
- **emit_event** event: `approval.rejected`
- **notify** — Requester notified of rejection with reason

**Result:** Request rejected and requester informed

### Approval_escalated (Priority: 7)

**Given:**
- timeout_hours exceeded for current level
- no sufficient approvals received

**Then:**
- **transition_state** field: `status` from: `in_review` to: `escalated`
- **emit_event** event: `approval.escalated`
- **notify** — Escalation target and requester notified of timeout

**Result:** Approval escalated to designated authority

### Approval_delegated (Priority: 8)

**Given:**
- approver has configured a valid delegation
- delegation is within its valid_until period

**Then:**
- **emit_event** event: `approval.delegated`
- **notify** — Delegate notified of approval responsibility

**Result:** Approval authority delegated; delegate can act on behalf of approver

### Auto_approved (Priority: 9)

**Given:**
- request matches configured auto-approve rules for current level

**Then:**
- **set_field** target: `current_level` value: `current_level + 1`
- **emit_event** event: `approval.approved`

**Result:** Level auto-approved by system based on configured rules

### Self_approval_blocked (Priority: 10) — Error: `APPROVAL_SELF_APPROVAL`

**Given:**
- approver_id equals requester_id

**Result:** Self-approval rejected
