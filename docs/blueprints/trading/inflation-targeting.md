## Actors

| ID | Name | Type | Description |
|----|------|------|-------------|
| `inflation_analyst` | Inflation Regime Analyst | system |  |

## Fields

| Name | Type | Required | Label | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `jurisdiction` | text | Yes | Central bank jurisdiction |  |
| `target_rate` | number | Yes | Explicit inflation target (percent) |  |
| `tolerance_band` | number | No | Symmetric tolerance around target (percent) |  |
| `horizon_months` | number | No | Medium-term horizon over which target applies |  |

## Rules

- **regime_features:**
  - **explicit_target:** Publicly announced numerical inflation target
  - **central_bank_independence:** Operational freedom to set policy tools
  - **transparency:** Regular reports, minutes, forecasts
  - **accountability:** Assessed against the announced target
  - **credibility:** Track record of hitting target anchors expectations
- **conditions_for_success:** Well-developed financial system, Flexible exchange rate, No fiscal dominance, Quality inflation data, Effective transmission via banking sector
- **comparison_to_alternatives:**
  - **monetary_aggregate_targeting:** Targets money supply growth — weak when money demand unstable
  - **exchange_rate_targeting:** Peg to anchor currency — surrenders monetary independence
  - **nominal_gdp_targeting:** Targets nominal spending — less common in practice
- **validation:**
  - **target_positive:** target_rate > 0
  - **jurisdiction_required:** jurisdiction present

## Outcomes

### Evaluate_regime (Priority: 1)

_Score credibility and effectiveness of an inflation-targeting regime_

**Given:**
- `jurisdiction` (input) exists
- `target_rate` (input) gt `0`

**Then:**
- **call_service** target: `inflation_analyst`
- **emit_event** event: `inflation.regime_evaluated`

### Invalid_target (Priority: 10) — Error: `INFL_INVALID_TARGET`

_Target must be positive_

**Given:**
- `target_rate` (input) lte `0`

**Then:**
- **emit_event** event: `inflation.regime_rejected`

### Missing_jurisdiction (Priority: 11) — Error: `INFL_JURISDICTION_MISSING`

_Jurisdiction missing_

**Given:**
- `jurisdiction` (input) not_exists

**Then:**
- **emit_event** event: `inflation.regime_rejected`
