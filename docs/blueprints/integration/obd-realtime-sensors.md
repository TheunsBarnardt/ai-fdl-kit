| `consumer` | Data Consumer | system | Application or UI layer receiving sensor updates via callbacks or direct queries |

## Fields

| Name | Type | Required | Label | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `engine_rpm` | number | No | Engine RPM |  |
| `vehicle_speed` | number | No | Vehicle Speed (km/h) |  |

## States

**State field:** `streaming_state`

**Values:**

| State | Initial | Terminal |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `idle` | Yes |  |
| `streaming` |  |  |
| `paused` |  |  |

**Transitions:**

| Name | From | To | Actor | Condition |
|------|------|----|-------|-----------|
|  | `idle` | `streaming` | system |  |
|  | `streaming` | `paused` | system |  |
|  | `paused` | `streaming` | system |  |
|  | `streaming` | `idle` | system |  |
|  | `paused` | `idle` | system |  |

## Rules

- **sensor_support:** Only query sensors that the vehicle advertises as supported via the PID support listing, Skip unsupported sensors silently during streaming; return null on direct query, Support is cached at connection time; do not re-query the support listing on each poll cycle
- **decoding:** RPM: two bytes — formula ((high × 256) + low) ÷ 4 — returns value in RPM, Speed: one byte — raw value equals speed in km/h — returns value in km/h, Coolant temperature: one byte — subtract 40 to get °C — range -40 to +215 °C, Throttle position: one byte — (raw ÷ 255) × 100 — returns percentage 0–100, MAF rate: two bytes — formula ((high × 256) + low) ÷ 100 — returns value in g/s, Fuel level: one byte — (raw ÷ 255) × 100 — returns percentage 0–100, All returned values carry explicit physical units; consumers must not assume a unit
- **streaming:** The polling loop must run in a separate thread or async task; it must not block the caller, Introduce a configurable delay between query cycles to avoid saturating the OBD-II bus, Invoke registered callbacks only when a sensor value changes from the previous poll, Multiple callbacks may be registered per sensor; invoke all of them in order, Sensor registration and deregistration are safe to call while streaming is active, A paused loop retains all registered sensors and callbacks
- **direct_query:** Any sensor may be queried on demand without starting the streaming loop, Direct queries follow the same support check and decoding rules as streaming

## Outcomes

### Sensor_not_supported (Priority: 1) — Error: `OBD_SENSOR_NOT_SUPPORTED`

**Given:**
- the requested sensor PID is not in the vehicle's advertised support set

**Then:**
- **emit_event** event: `obd.sensor.unsupported`

**Result:** Returns a null response; sensor is excluded from streaming without error

### Not_connected (Priority: 2) — Error: `OBD_NOT_CONNECTED`

**Given:**
- vehicle connection is not in vehicle_connected state

**Then:**
- **transition_state** field: `streaming_state` from: `streaming` to: `idle`

**Result:** Active streaming loop stops; all pending sensor queries return null

### Direct_query_success (Priority: 5)

**Given:**
- vehicle is connected
- sensor PID is supported by the vehicle
- caller requests a single on-demand reading

**Then:**
- **emit_event** event: `obd.sensor.reading`

**Result:** Returns the decoded sensor value with its physical unit to the caller

### Streaming_started (Priority: 6)

**Given:**
- vehicle is connected
- at least one sensor is registered for watching
- streaming_state is idle

**Then:**
- **transition_state** field: `streaming_state` from: `idle` to: `streaming`
- **emit_event** event: `obd.streaming.started`

**Result:** Background polling loop starts; all registered sensors are queried on each cycle

### Sensor_value_changed (Priority: 7)

**Given:**
- streaming_state is streaming
- a polled sensor returns a value different from the previous poll

**Then:**
- **emit_event** event: `obd.sensor.changed`

**Result:** All callbacks registered for this sensor are invoked with the new value

### Streaming_paused (Priority: 8)

**Given:**
- streaming_state is streaming
- caller requests a temporary pause

**Then:**
- **transition_state** field: `streaming_state` from: `streaming` to: `paused`
- **emit_event** event: `obd.streaming.paused`

**Result:** Polling loop suspends; registered sensors and callbacks are retained

### Streaming_stopped (Priority: 9)

**Given:**
- streaming_state is streaming or paused
- caller stops the loop or deregisters all sensors

**Then:**
- **transition_state** field: `streaming_state` from: `streaming` to: `idle`
- **emit_event** event: `obd.streaming.stopped`

**Result:** Background polling loop terminates; no further callbacks are invoked

## Errors

| Code | Status | Message | Retry |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| `OBD_SENSOR_NOT_SUPPORTED` | 422 | This vehicle does not support the requested sensor. | No |
| `OBD_NOT_CONNECTED` | 503 | No active vehicle connection. Connect before reading sensors. | No |

## Events

| Event | Description | Payload |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `obd.sensor.reading` | A single on-demand sensor query returned a decoded value | `sensor_name`, `sensor_value`, `sensor_unit`, `timestamp` |
| `obd.sensor.changed` | A streaming sensor value changed from the previous poll cycle | `sensor_name`, `sensor_value`, `previous_value`, `sensor_unit`, `timestamp` |
| `obd.sensor.unsupported` | A query or registration was attempted for a sensor the vehicle does not support | `sensor_name` |
| `obd.streaming.started` | Continuous sensor polling loop has started | `watched_sensors`, `poll_interval_ms` |
| `obd.streaming.paused` | Sensor polling loop has been temporarily suspended | `watched_sensors` |
| `obd.streaming.stopped` | Sensor polling loop has terminated | `watched_sensors` |
