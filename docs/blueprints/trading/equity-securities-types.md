## Rules

- **common_shares:**
  - **residual_claim:** Last in line for assets and earnings
  - **voting_rights:** One share one vote (typical); may have dual-class
  - **dividends:** Discretionary, paid after debt and preferred
- **preferred_shares:**
  - **cumulative:** Unpaid dividends accumulate; must be paid before common dividends
  - **participating:** Receive extra dividends when common exceeds threshold
  - **convertible:** Convert to common at pre-set ratio
  - **callable:** Issuer can redeem at call price
  - **putable:** Holder can force redemption
- **voting_variants:**
  - **statutory:** One vote per share per director
  - **cumulative:** Votes can be concentrated on one nominee
  - **dual_class:** Super-voting shares retained by founders
- **non_domestic_access:**
  - **direct_investing:** Buy on foreign exchange; FX and settlement risk
  - **depository_receipts:**
    - **sponsored_adr:** Issuer-backed ADR; levels I-III increase disclosure
    - **unsponsored_adr:** No issuer cooperation; limited voting
    - **gdr:** Global DR, often traded in London/Luxembourg
- **risk_return:**
  - **risk:** Standard deviation of returns; preferred less volatile than common
  - **return:** Price change plus dividends; currency effects for ADR/GDR
- **validation:**
  - **security_required:** security_id present
  - **valid_type:** equity_type in [common, preferred]

## Outcomes

_Record classification and features of an equity security_

**Given:**
- `security_id` (input) exists
- `equity_type` (input) in `common,preferred`

**Then:**
- **call_service** target: `equity_taxonomist`
- **emit_event** event: `equity_security.classified`

### Invalid_type (Priority: 10) — Error: `EQ_INVALID_TYPE`

_Unsupported equity type_

**Given:**
- `equity_type` (input) not_in `common,preferred`

**Then:**
- **emit_event** event: `equity_security.classification_rejected`

### Goals

#### Reliable Equity Securities Types

Classify common and preferred equity variants — voting, participating, cumulative, convertible, callable, putable — and capture their cash-flow and control rights

**Success Metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| policy_violation_rate | 0% | Operations that violate defined policies |
| audit_completeness | 100% | All decisions have complete audit trails |

**Constraints:**

- **regulatory** (non-negotiable): All operations must be auditable and traceable

### Autonomy

**Level:** `supervised`

**Human Checkpoints:**

- before making irreversible changes

**Escalation Triggers:**

- `error_rate > 5`
- `consecutive_failures > 3`

### Verification

**Invariants:**

- error messages never expose internal system details

### Tradeoffs

| Prefer | Over | Reason |
|--------|------|--------|
| accuracy | latency | trading operations require precise execution and full audit trails |

### Safety

| Action | Permission | Cooldown | Max Auto |
|--------|------------|----------|----------|
| classify_equity_security | `autonomous` | - | - |
| invalid_type | `autonomous` | - | - |
